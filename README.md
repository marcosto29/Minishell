# Minishell

## Description

The Minishell is a project focused on the deep study of Bash and it's functionality

The objective is to emulate a "limited" Bash terminal with C. Managing pipes, communication, command execution (with arguments and options), keyboard signals, etc.

At the end, the project would exectue correctly Bash commands such as _ls_ and even more complex ones like _cat < input.txt | ls -l > output.txt_. Parsing, redirecting and executing everything correctly.

## Instructions

This projects includes a Makefile, making it more easy to complie with the use of the _make_ command from the root of of the project.

Once compiled, to execute it, write _./minishell_ on the terminal to make it work

## Recursos

This project has been developed thanks to the [_Linux documentation_](https://man7.org/index.html) and the [_GNU documentation_](https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html) where is clearly explained the behaviour of the Bash terminal and its functions.

Copilot has been used to complement this information (never asking it to create code or functionality from scratch).

Finally, a lot of youtube videos created by the community has been also used to gain information.
